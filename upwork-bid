These are the projects In which I have worked and delivered successfully. I have great experience with e-commerce, social media, and Saas applications.

I am eager to learn new technologies.

Hello,

Can we have a quick discussion over chat/call about the requirements?

I am a Python developer with 3+ years of experience in data scraping and web scraping. My primary stack is Python, web crawler, Scrappy, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Docker, AWS, Elastic Search, Data mining, Rest APIs, Numpy, Pandas, MySQL, and I am able to extract information from a publicly accessible website.

I am fluent in English and available on chat/voice to understand the project's exact scope.
I am available 40+ hours a week and will be available anytime for work. I can work for 3-4 hours during GMT.

I can join your project now and provide with the required amount of hours. I suggest we can schedule a call to discuss the details of your projects and see how we can work together.

Hope to talk to you soon.

Thanks,
Sunil
